# PitchPerfectRecorder
AVFoundation

An iPhone app built in Swift 2.3 that records audio, such as a conversation between you and friend, and then makes your voices sound like a chipmunk or Darth Vader.

The app has buttons that will change the pitch or speed of the audio, or adds effects such as reverb to the audio.

The audio files are not persisted between app openings and closings.
